## PuppyLuv

### App Description
PuppyLuv is an app that allows dog owners and dog lovers to connect with one another. 

### App Idea Evaluation

- Category: Dating, Social Networking.
- Mobile: PuppyLuv will be a fully mobile-based service, and is integral to finding potential playmates and partners. Camera will be used to take pictures of themselves and their dogs for their bios. GPS may be used to find a good meeting place.
- Story: Allows people to find dates for themselves, for their dogs, or just to hangout and spend some time. PuppyLuv also makes it easier to find and arrange meetups and events for dogs in the case there is one nearby.
- Market: Dog-lovers, dog owners.
- Habit: People would first set up their profiles and bios. After the initial setup, said users would often be searching for other dog owners to set playdates with. People can search their area for others who also have dogs.
- Scope: V1 would allow users to find other pet owners to have playdates with. V2 would allow for users that do not have dogs to find people with dogs. V3 or V4 would potentially allow users to arrange and find meetups and events for their pet(s).
